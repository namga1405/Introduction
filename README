Hi all, I am Nam, a second-year currently studying in the University of Melbourne, majoring in Data Science. This GitHub will include a lot of my projects from high school until now, ranging from data analysis to games to some code just for the fun of it.
My aspiration is to become a data analyst, but the main reason that I decide to have this is to keep track of my progression and to remind myself of the times when I developed these applications. From time to time, I would come back here just to look at some of
the old codes that I developed either to find motivations or because I have nothing else to do:))).
